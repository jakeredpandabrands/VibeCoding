# VibeCoding

A playful sandbox for **vibe-coding** and experimenting with Cursor. This repo exists to explore what Cursor can do — how fast I can ship cool, lightweight stuff when the vibes are right.

## What's in here?

**Individual micro-projects**, each in its own subfolder. No code explosion, just isolated experiments.

```
vibe-coding/
├── be-the-better-deal/   # Amazon price & deal tracker
├── cool-stuff/           # Blind auction party game
├── ...
```

## Ground rules

- **One subproject = one folder** — keep everything self-contained
- **Lightweight & fast** — build small, ship quick, iterate
- **Promotion path** — when a project deserves more love, it gets copied into a dedicated repo
- **Sandbox energy** — this is for playing, not production pressure

## Get vibing

Pick a folder, start building, and see what Cursor can do. 🚀
